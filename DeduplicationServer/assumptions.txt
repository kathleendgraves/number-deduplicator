Assumptions:
1. One log file is to be created per run of the Application as opposed to one log file per client.
2. The log file is to be created in the OS-dependent temporary folder.
3. The server does not respond to the client except to send a disconnect message upon invalid input.
4. The report is a summary of all client input.
